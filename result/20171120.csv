Obtained the logic tree that resulted from the best point given the amount of time available.","Mostly straightforward, some architectures were hard to guess.",

Then spend the remaining time testing those patterns in the feature analysis tab.,"It was familiar to me from SYS5400 class, but I could see how it's confusing for someone without prior knowledge on identifying good features",
